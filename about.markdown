# About Me

My name is Leonardo Goller, and I am a PhD student in
[Geometry and Mathematical Physics](https://www.math.sissa.it/content/geometry-and-mathematical-physics-0)
at [Scuola Internazionale Superiore di Studi Avanzati
(SISSA)](https://www.sissa.it/). I work under the supervision of [Marcello Porta](https://sites.google.com/view/marcelloporta/home) on rigorous derivations of Effective Actions and Topological transport properties of Floquet Many Body systems.

## Interests

1. Quantum Many Body Systems
2. Renormalization Group Flow
3. Topological Phases of Matter
4. Anomalies
5. Lattice Gauge Theories
6. Constructive QFT
