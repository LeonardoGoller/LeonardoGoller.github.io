# About Me

My name is Leonardo Goller, and I am a PhD student in
[Geometry and Mathematical Physics](https://www.math.sissa.it/content/geometry-and-mathematical-physics-0)
at [Scuola Internazionale Superiore di Studi Avanzati
(SISSA)](https://www.sissa.it/). For my master thesis in the University of Leipzig, I studied long range entangled gappless spin states using [Jordan-Wigner transformations][https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.13116.pdf] under the supervision of [Inti Sodemann][https://home.uni-leipzig.de/qcmt/home.html]. I am now working under the supervision of [Marcello Porta](https://sites.google.com/view/marcelloporta/home) on rigorous derivations of Effective Actions and Topological transport properties of Floquet Many Body systems. 

## Interests

1. Quantum Many Body Systems
2. Renormalization Group Flow
3. Topological Phases of Matter
4. Anomalies
5. Lattice Gauge Theories
6. Constructive QFT
